This project is a weather station that collects real-time data from sensors connected to an Arduino. 
The Arduino communicates with a Java application using libraries such as jSerialComm or the JSSC jar file for serial communication. ⚠️⚠️
The Java application then stores the data in a MySQL database managed by XAMPP, using the MySQL Connector jar ⚠️⚠️ for database connectivity. 
Additionally, the project utilizes Eclipse's Database Development perspective ⚠️⚠️ to connect and manage the database directly within the IDE. 
The stored data is retrieved by the Java application and displayed in a graphical user interface (GUI).
